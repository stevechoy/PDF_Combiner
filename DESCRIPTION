Description: PDF Combiner is a simple R Shiny App that supports merging of pdf and/or image files with page selection, removal, or rotation options.
    It is a fast, free, and secure alternative to commercial software or various online websites which require users to sign-up, and it avoids any potential risks associated with uploading files elsewhere.
